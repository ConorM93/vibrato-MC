# vibrato-MC
Code for Vibrato Monte Carlo methods. This was done for a case study for Oxford's MMSC. This is the paper it was originally introduced in https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/gilesm/files/mcqmc08.pdf.
We adapt it for certain second order Greeks (Gamma and Vanna). It is done using second order vibrato, derived similarly to the paper.
