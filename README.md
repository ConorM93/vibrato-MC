# vibrato-MC
Code for Vibrato Monte Carlo methods. This was done for a case study for Oxford's MMSC. This is the paper it was originally introduced in https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/gilesm/files/mcqmc08.pdf.
We use it also for second order Greeks as in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.06143.pdf. We implement directly rather than automatic differentiation
